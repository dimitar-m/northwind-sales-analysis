# Northwind Sales Analysis: Identifying Key Product Performers and Growth Opportunities

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from Northwind Traders with the goal of uncovering key product performers, identifying growth opportunities, and gaining insights to support data-driven decision-making. By applying SQL and Python for data manipulation, visualization, and in-depth analysis, this work demonstrates techniques that enhance sales understanding and drive business outcomes.

## Project Goals
The main objectives of this analysis are:
- **Identify** the top-performing products based on cumulative sales.
- **Analyze** sales trends across different product categories.
- **Understand** growth patterns to reveal potential areas for improvement.

## Methodology
The approach combines SQL queries and Python libraries to query, manipulate, and visualize data. Key methodologies include:
- **SQL Analysis**: Advanced SQL techniques, including window functions and common table expressions (CTEs), were employed to aggregate sales data, calculate running totals, and perform in-depth trend analysis.
- **Python Integration**: SQL results were converted to Pandas DataFrames, enabling further analysis with Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
- **Visualization**: Visualizations were used to create a cohesive story of product and category performance, showing trends and top performers effectively.

## Technologies Used
This project showcases a variety of data science tools and techniques:
- **Database Connection**: Authentication managed through SQLAlchemy and `os` library for secure handling of environment variables.
- **SQL in Jupyter Notebook**: SQL queries were executed within a Jupyter environment, integrating results directly into the analysis pipeline.
- **Data Transformation with Pandas**: DataFrames facilitated deeper analysis and smooth integration between SQL results and Python.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn, presenting complex insights in an accessible, visual format.

## Key Insights and Results
Through this analysis, several impactful insights were discovered:
1. **Top Products**: Products such as *Côte de Blaye* and *Thüringer Rostbratwurst* stand out with the highest total sales, highlighting key revenue drivers.
2. **Category Trends**: Certain categories showed sustained growth, while others revealed seasonal trends and fluctuating demand patterns.
3. **Growth Opportunities**: Insights from growth trends and product rankings suggest areas where targeted efforts could increase sales, specifically through product promotion or stock adjustments.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a practical demonstration of data analysis skills, from querying and managing data to presenting insights visually. By integrating SQL, Python, and data visualization techniques, the analysis provides actionable business insights that can contribute to strategic decisions at Northwind Traders.
